We designed a system for wirelessly controlling relays and monitoring current.  This is used for a home load simulation.  By wirelessly turning relays on and off by sending commands from a PC to a microcontroller we can change the total load (current) to our simulated home.  For wireless communication, we used XBee Series 2 Zigbee RF modules.  One of these modules was connected to a microcontroller and the home load simulation, while another was connected to the PC, which was used for collecting and displaying data as well as for relay monitoring and control.

This project is the PC-side Java code.
